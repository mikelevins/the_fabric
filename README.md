# The Fabric
A persistent, networked, multiplayer, science-fiction roleplaying game

## Overview

The Fabric is a science-fiction roleplaying game for multiple players set in a far-future version of our solar system. In The Fabric's game world, human civilization has spread throughout the solar system and grown in population and complexity. At the same time, robots and computing machinery have evolved even faster. The setting for the game is a vast cyberspace network that surrounds and permeates the physical solar system. Players control artificial intelligences that live in that cyberspace.

The Fabric is a multiplayer sandbox roleplaying game with theme-park elements. In other words, the basic design is intended to provide a rich simulated world with open-ended opportunities for exploration, commerce, diplomacy, war, crime, and punishment. At the same time, structured missions and story arcs are provided to enable new and inexperienced players to learn the ropes and gain enough experience to choose the playstyles that suit them best.

## Status

The Fabric is at a pre-alpha stage of development. Many basic parts of the game's infrastructure are working, and some surface features as well, but other systems still need a lot of work. It's not yet playable, unless you just want to tour the future solar system and visit cities and other parts of the landscape that are under construction.

The Fabric was presented by Per Bothner to the JavaOne conference in San Francisco in October of 2015 as an example of a nontrivial JVM application written using Per's Kawa Scheme compiler. The presentation included two brief gameplay demos and an hour-long discussion of how Kawa Scheme made it possible for a single programmer to get so much of the infrastructure working in a short time.
